Creational patterns:
    These patterns will be used at the time of object creation
    1. Singleton -> Always return the same object only
    2. factory -> To create multiple objects at runtime

Behavioral patterns:
    1. Observer -> notifying multiple objects of a change to keep them
                   in sync.
    2. Template -> Give a template base convention. Having an abstarct base class.
